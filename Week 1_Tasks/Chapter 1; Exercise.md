## Chapter 1; Exercise.

##### Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?

​						*Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle.*


##### Exercise 2: What is a program? 

​						*This is source code written in one or more given programming languages to solve a given problem.*


##### Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter? 

​						*A compiler is a program that converts source code into an executable while an interpreter is a program that converts uncompiled source code written in a given programming language into a low level language each line at a time during execution.*


##### Exercise 4: Which of the following contains “machine code”?

​                       The key board.


##### Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:

##### >>> primt 'Hello world!'

##### File "<stdin>", line 1

##### primt 'Hello world!'

##### ^

##### SyntaxError: invalid syntax

##### >>>

​			*It has a syntax error due to misspelling of the print function.*

 

##### Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after the following Python line finishes?

##### x = 123

##### a) Central processing unit
##### b) Main Memory
##### c) Secondary Memory
##### d) Input Devices
##### e) Output Devices

​													 *b) Main memory.*


##### Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:

##### x = 43
##### x = x - 1
##### print(x)

##### a) 43
##### b) 42
##### c) x + 1
##### d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically

​															*b) 42.*


##### Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:

#####  (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3)Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example, “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”

​                             *(1) Central processing unit, - The brain.*

​                            *(2) Main Memory, - The short term memory.*

​                           *(3) Secondary Memory, - The long term memory.*

​                          *(4) Input Device, and - The eyes.*

​                         *(5) Output Device -The nose [ carbon(iv)oxide ].* 


##### Exercise 9: How do you fix a “Syntax Error”?

- *You look up the proper spelling/format in the documentation of the given programming language or module/library.*

- *The interpreter may offer a suggestion that you can use.*

- *On the command line, type **py** then **type help(<the term you misspelt>)** and the interpreter will offer suggestions.*
