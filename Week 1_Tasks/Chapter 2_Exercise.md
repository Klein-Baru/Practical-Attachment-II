##### Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
#####                                           width = 17
#####                                           height = 12.0
##### For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the
##### type (of the value of the expression).
*1. width//2 = 8 ; an integer.*
*2. width/2.0 = 8.5; a float.*
*3. height/3 = 4.0; a float.*
4. 1 + 2 * 5 = 11; an integer.
