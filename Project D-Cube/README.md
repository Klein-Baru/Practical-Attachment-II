This is an [Internet of Things(IoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) project aimed at developing, collecting and analyzing river water-level data as part of [MY](https://github.com/Klein-Baru) third year attachment at [DeKUT-DSAIL](https://dekut-dsail.github.io/).

Why the title Project D-Cube? The project title is inspired by the barebone steps of **D**evelopment, **D**eployment and **D**ata Science-ing involved in coming up with a complete IoT solution. It also hails from the pop culture exaggeration of tech-based projects😂e.g. Project X or Project A-X-L from the movie A-X-L.

This project is being done in conjunction, collaboration and supervision by [Jason N. Kabi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabi-jason-b14b68164)
