PROJECT D-CUBE.

This is an [Internet of Things(IoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) project aimed at developing, collecting and analyzing river water-level data as part of my third year attachment at [DeKUT-DSAIL](https://dekut-dsail.github.io/).

Why the title Project D-Cube? The project title is inspired by the barebone steps of Development, Deployment and Data Science-ing involved in coming up with a complete IoT solution. It also hails from the pop culture exaggeration of tech-based projectsðŸ˜‚e.g. Project X or Project A-X-L from the movie A-X-L.
